/**
 * This class is for testing the Graphics class. Graphics class holds all the interactions of the UI and game logic.
 * The tests includes integrations testing and individual tests in isolation. The integration testing mainly consists
 * of testing the player's ability to move around the map and checking if the UI reflects the movement and making sure
 * the game is still functioning. The individual testing included player positioning with respect to items and certain
 * locations such as the exit zone. Once player lands on any of the items, the tests will check if all conditions are
 * met and satisfied. The purpose of testing these methods is to check if all functions classified as UI components
 * are properly interacting with the game board, the logic and game conditions.
