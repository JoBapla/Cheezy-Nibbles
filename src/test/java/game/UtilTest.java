/**
 * This class tests the Util class method which only includes the dist method. The dist method uses the distance formula
 * to compare and find the distance between two objects. In this case, the player X and Y coordinates are compared with
 * the enemy's X and Y coordinates. It will return a value and that value will be used to check if it is less or greater
 * than the set range that the enemy has.
 * <p>
 * The test will individually evaluate if the dist method will output the correct values when inputting them into the
 * distance formula. Using JUnit 5, we are able to use AssertAll to check different coordinate values for both player
 * and enemies at the same time. This time we will not be using @BeforeEach since there is no setup method. This is
 * because we do not need to initialize an object of the class as a result of the original method in Util Class being
 * a static method.
