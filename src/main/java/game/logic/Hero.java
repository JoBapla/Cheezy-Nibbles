/**
 * This class inherits the Character class and adds attributes specific to the Hero.
 * Hero class mainly consists of the hero's ability to move around the game map. This means adjusting the direction
 * speed of the hero so it moves in the specific direction that the user allows it to move and the game itself.
 * Though the Hero class has all the traits that a classified character has that exists in the game, the hero carries its
 * own type so it is still considered as a designated character on screen but it distinguishes as a hero type.
 * <p>
 * The methods inside this class is immediately used when the player uses the KeyPressed method to detect user's
 * keystrokes. This all happens in the Graphics class and will be further documented their. For each tick in the game,
 * the hero will increase or decrease its speed or in other sense, the direction, meaning negative speed is in the
 * opposite direction of the positive speed for both X and Y directions.
